            <p>Cut your bottle bottom part </p>
            <h1>2.make your bottle cap </h1>
            <img src="img/captube.jpg" alt=""><img src="img/capinside.jpg" alt="">
            <p>make a hole that is fit for tube conneters make sure that the connecter is tight to get in the cap other wise it will leak water.then seal the connecters side you can seal it with fevi quick make sure that it will not leak </p>           
            <h1>3.connect to the air pump</h1>
            <img src="img/allconnect.jpg" alt="">
            <p>connect the tube to the connecter that is in the cap of bottle.connect the other end to the air pump.cut the center of the tube and connect it wit the connecter there is a need of it .it is i the next step.</p>
            <h1>4.start the procces of hatching</h1>
            <img src="img/water.jpg" alt="">
            <p>fill the sea water or salt water (33g for 1l of water)use sea water it is better than artifitial salt water in the bottle use 3/4 of the bottle seen in the image.give airetion to the bottle for 1/2 hour without any thing to water it gives better result.after airetion based on your tank (1/4 of a spoon represent 10 tanks) put artemia in the bottle and give airetion for 24 hours .after 24 hours you will see that the color of the artemia will change to a redish color it means that the artemia has hatched </p>
            <h1>4.take the artemia</h1>
            <img src="img/taking.jpg" alt="">
            <p>take a cup and put your artemia on that cup .note that dont put the artemia caps in the cup like shown in the next step </p>
            <h1>5.remove the artemia caps</h1>
            <img src="img/end.jpg" alt="">
            <p>during the flow through of artemia through the tube and the water is going down when the water is going down the artemia caps will be on the top of the water so that when the water is decresed to the cap of the bottle stop the flow of the water and discared that artemia  </p>
            <h1>6.separate salt water and artemia </h1>
            <img src="img/seprate.jpg" alt="">
            <p>take a mesh spoon and flow through the water and the artemia will be on that mesh spoon so take it to the other cup</p>
